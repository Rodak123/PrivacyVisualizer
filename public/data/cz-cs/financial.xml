    Payment information, such as form of payment, payment card number, or
    bank account number. If an app uses a payment service (like Stripe,
    Shopify, or Paypal), and is not collected, it does not need to be
    disclosed in a privacy policy. You should read the privacy policy of
    whatever payment service a given app or website is using to understand
    how they collect and protect your data as well. This category can also
    contain your credit score, salary, income, assets, debts, or any other
    financial information.

    Stolen credit card information, phishing attacks, or identity theft.
    This is one of the most sought-after types of data in a data breach, and
    is certainly the most lucrative when it is stolen. This type of data
    collection can lead to a lot of stress that is out of your control once
    it is breached.
