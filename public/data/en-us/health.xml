    Health and medical data, which includes data from any user provided
    health or medical data. This also contains fitness and exercise data,
    including the Motion and Fitness API. This includes things like your
    deviceâ€™s accelerometers, gyroscopes, pedometer, magnetometer, and
    barometer. This can be collected for user interactions, fitness
    tracking, health-related matters, and more. For example, a game might
    use accelerometer and gyroscope input to control on screen game
    behavior, which technically falls under this health category as motion
    data.

  <benefits>
    Having a music playlist go along with a workout. Having a third-party
    health tracking app track steps (like Garmin, Pokemon Go). This data
    normally requires permission to be collected, but please ensure it is
    optional within the privacy policy.
  </benefits>
  <consequences>
    While not normally sold, data that is collected could be used against
    you in insurance-related schemes, as we have seen before.
